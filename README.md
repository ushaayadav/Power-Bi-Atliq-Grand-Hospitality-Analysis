I have created another amazing dashboard. In this, you will get to know about the revenue insights that are generated and used by the revenue team at 𝐀𝐭𝐥𝐢𝐐 𝐆𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐬 to analyze their business effectively.

✅ 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭-

Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue.

The sole objective was to create an interactive dashboard for AtliQ Grands that would help them to monitor key metrics across their hotels located in various different metro cities.
